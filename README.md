# pbe-phaserifier
<a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/box2d-editor/">Physics Body Editor</a> (I'll call it PBE for short) is used to create physics bodies from images. The Phaserifier is a simple HTML document that takes the output file from PBE and outputs the reworked data from it. This data will be compatible with <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>'s P2 physics.

# How to use
1. Open the **jar** file from this repository or <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/box2d-editor/downloads">download</a> a different version of PBE. Keep in mind that versions different from **2.9.2** might have different output and the Phaserifier might not work.
2. Create a new project.
3. Add some rigid bodies.
4. Click save when you're done.
5. Open the Phaserifier document.
6. Put the PBE output file in the Phaserifier.
7. Click **PHASERIFY**.
8. You get an output code that is compatible with Phaser.

# Disclaimer
I **do not** own Physics Body Editor and I **did not** make it. Credits for that go to <a href="http://www.aurelienribon.com/blog/">Aurelien Ribon</a>. I've uploaded the **physics-body-editor-2.9.2.jar** file merely because I used that version while making the Phaserifier. Other versions can be downloaded <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/box2d-editor/downloads">here</a>.
