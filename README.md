# pbe-phaserifier
<a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/box2d-editor/">Physics Body Editor</a> (PBE for short) is used to create physics bodies from images. The Phaserifier is a simple HTML document that takes the output file from PBE and outputs the reworked data from it. This data will be compatible with Phaser's P2 physics.

# Disclaimer
I **do not** own Physics Body Editor and I **did not** make it. Credits for that go to <a href="http://www.aurelienribon.com/blog/">Aurelien Ribon</a>. I've uploaded the _physics-body-editor-2.9.2.jar_ file merely because I used that version while making the Phaserifier. Other versions can be downloaded <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/box2d-editor/downloads">here</a>.
